All the sorting methods

SONG OF THE WEEK: GODS PLAN -- DRAKE (TEMPORARY)


## Bubble Sort

**Best Case:** Already sorted
If it's already sorted, then bubble will not have to make any swaps, going over the array just once, and it will be the most efficient.

**Worst Case:** Backwards Sorted
If it's backwards sorted, bubble will have to swap every single index multiple times, leading to the least efficient way.

## Selection Sort

**Best Case:** Doesn't matter
Selection swaps things with itself anyways, so it doesn't matter, because even if it was sorted there would still be swaps.

**Worst Case:** Backwards Sorted
hmm according to the logic above there is also no worst case

## Insertion Sort

**Best Case:** Already sorted
<br>Insertion won't have to swap anything if the array is already sorted.

**Worst Case:** Backwards Sorted
Insertion will have to swap every time the array length is increased.
