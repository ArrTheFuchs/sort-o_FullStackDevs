All the sorting methods

SONG OF THE WEEK: ------ -- x0o0x_


## Bubble Sort

**Best Case:** Already sorted <br>
If it's already sorted, then bubble will not have to make any swaps, going over the array just once, and it will be the most efficient.

**Worst Case:** Backwards Sorted <br>
If it's backwards sorted, bubble will have to swap every single index multiple times, leading to the least efficient way.

## Selection Sort

**Best Case:** Doesn't matter <br>
Selection swaps things with itself anyways, so it doesn't matter, because even if it was sorted there would still be swaps.

**Worst Case:** Backwards Sorted <br>
hmm according to the logic above there is also no worst case

## Insertion Sort

**Best Case:** Already sorted <br>
Insertion won't have to swap anything if the array is already sorted.

**Worst Case:** Backwards Sorted <br>
Insertion will have to swap every time the array length is increased.
